1. Arrays.sort() for primitive types : Does not provide you to provide custom comparator, you can only sort in increasing order/natural order/decreasing order.
Note : this is only for primitive types not for non-primitive type

2. SELECTION SORT
-Comparision based algo
-Less memory writes.Cycle Sort is optimal in terms of memory writes
  - memory writes can be costly operation EEPROM, in EEPROM if we do more writes, age of memory reduces
  - memory writes putting data on hard disk
  -etc
 - Basic Idea for Heap Sort
 - Not Stable(in case of duplicates, it does not gurantee to maintain the order)
 - Not inplace(doesnot require extra data structure to sort)
