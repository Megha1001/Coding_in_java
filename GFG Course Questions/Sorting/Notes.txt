Sorting in Java
  - Arrays
    - Primitive - dual pivot Quick sort --Stability doesn't matter --> fast then collections
    - Non-primitive - based on merge sort and adaptation of timSort --> stability matters --> slightly slow then dual pivot quick sort
  - Collections
    - Non-primitive - based on merge sort and adaption of timSort --> stability matters.
 
 Quick sort - unstable, Merge sort - stable
 
 
 Arrays
  - Methods
    Arrays.sort(arr); //sort in natural order
    Arrays.sort(arr,start, end); --> [start, end)
    Arrays.sort(arr, Collections.reverseOrder()); //sort in non-increasing order
    
 Collections
  - Methods
    Colletions.sort(list) --> accepts on linkinterface --> ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
    Collections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder())
   
   
   
Stable & Unstable algo
Stable - for two same value of comparing field in object it maintain the order of appearing in given inpu

Stable Algo : Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort (IBM)
Non stable : Selection sort, Quick Sort, heap sort (SHQ)


BUBBLE SORT
Comparision based sorting
Passes require to sort n elements : n-1
