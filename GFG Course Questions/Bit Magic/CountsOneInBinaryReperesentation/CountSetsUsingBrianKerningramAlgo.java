/*
Use : Brian Kerningram's algo
Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit.
    10-> 1010
    9-> 1001
    8-> 1000
So if we subtract a number by 1 & do it bitwise '&' with itself (n & (n - 1)) , we unset th rightmost
bit if we do 'n & (n-1)' in a loop and count the number of times loop executes, we get the set bit counts.

No of times its loops is executes = No. of bits in integer

TIME COMPLEXITY : Î˜(No of sets bits in integer)
